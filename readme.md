#Tea Store Project

This is an exported project that I have built within the course of studying Webflow. It is a simple tea store website that I have built using Webflow.

I have used the following features in this project:

- Webflow CMS
- Display: flex
- Display: grid
- Interaction triggers
- Lazy loading
- Mobile responsive styling
- Responsive fonts, etc.
